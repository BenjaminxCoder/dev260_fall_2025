## About This Repository
This repository contains all coursework completed for DEV 260: Data Structures & Algorithms in C#. Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience implementing core data structures, analyzing algorithmic performance, and designing efficient solutions to real-world problems. The repository includes labs, assignments, and a fully implemented final project written in C# with a small Python integration.

## Projects

### Labs
- **Lab Loops and Conditionals:** Practiced control flow, branching logic, and basic C# program structure.
- **Lab Collections:** Worked with fundamental .NET collection types such as List<T> and Dictionary<T>.
- **Lab Stacks:** Implemented stack operations and understood LIFO behavior.
- **Lab Queues:** Explored queue operations and FIFO processing patterns.
- **Lab Hashsets:** Learned how hashing enables fast lookups and unique collections.
- **Lab Trees:** Built and traversed tree structures, practicing depth-first and breadth-first operations.

### Assignments
- **Assignment DS Foundations:** Introduced big-O notation, indexing trade-offs, and algorithm selection.
- **Assignment Linked Lists:** Implemented singly and doubly linked lists with insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Assignment Stacks:** Built a custom stack class and used stack-based algorithms.
- **Assignment Queues:** Designed queue structures and implemented circular queue logic.
- **Assignment Hashsets:** Explored collision handling, hashing strategies, and set operations.
- **Assignment Trees:** Created binary trees, performed traversals, and analyzed subtree operations.
- **Assignment Graphs:** Implemented graphs, BFS, DFS, and shortest-path algorithms.

### Final Project
**CashFlow Coach — Budget Management Assistant (C# + Python AI)**

A local-first budgeting application that helps users track income and expenses, search by category or date, view summaries, and automatically categorize uncategorized transactions using a Python-powered classifier. Core data structures include a primary Dictionary store, a SortedDictionary time index, and a category HashSet index.

## How to Run
Each project contains its own README with build/run steps.

**General steps:**
```bash
# Example: cd ./assignments/BST_File_system
cd [project-directory]
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Tips for Success
- Use `git status` frequently to track changes
- Test builds after cleanup to ensure stability
- Review your repository in GitHub to see it from an employer’s perspective
- Maintain a clean `.gitignore` to avoid committing build artifacts
- Keep descriptions concise but meaningful

## Why This Matters
A well-organized repository is part of a professional developer’s portfolio. Employers often review GitHub activity when evaluating candidates. Clean structure, clear documentation, and working code demonstrate:
- Professionalism
- Organizational skill
- Communication ability
- Attention to detail

This repository reflects the growth, learning, and engineering discipline developed throughout DEV 260.
